        Raden Ajeng Kartini is one of the most phenomenal heroes in Indonesia. During her life, 
        Kartini had never taken up arms to challenge the Dutch. However, her name is equated with 
        the heroes of independence in history books. This is none other than the inspiration and thought 
        that she inherited to Indonesian women. For the sake of remembering her, in 1964, President 
        Soekarno set the third week in April as Kartini Day.

        In the past women were deliberately positioned below men in social caste. In Indonesia 
        tradition, it is certainly not much different. During the colonialism, Indonesian 
        women were not allowed to pursue higher education. Even today, the expression of why 
        pursue higher education if you only end up in the kitchen, also often buzzes in society.

        She began to open to the idea of ​feminism in Europe that was developing at that time. 
        It was started from her hobby of reading newspapers, magazines, and books given by 
        her pen pal in the Netherlands, Rosa Abendanon. She paid attention to the problems 
        of Indonesian women relating to equality of rights, freedom, autonomy, and equality 
        in the eyes of the law.

        Kartini realized that the best step to initiate emancipation for Indonesian women 
        was through education. Therefore she was determined to build the first women’s 
        school. It was finally succeeded to establish next to the Rembang Regency government 
        office at that time. Kartini is aware that a strong educational background can pioneer 
        the achievement of the emancipation of Indonesian women in the future.

      <p>
        As expected, Kartini’s thought began to show results. Today, many Indonesian women lead 
        large companies, become athletes, scientists, and reliable diplomat. The meaning of ‘Habis 
        Gelap Terbitlah Terang’ doesn’t linger only on words.
