                    <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has 
                        efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective 
                        approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and 
                        dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal 
                        language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas 
                        on most platforms</p>

                    <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely 
                        available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the 
                        Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely 
                        distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers 
                        to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and 
                        additional documentation.</p>

                    <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data 
                        types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). 
                        Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable 
                        applications.</p>

                    <header>Using Python as a Calculator</header>
                    <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression 
                        at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: 
                        the operators +, -, * and / can be used to perform arithmetic; parentheses 
                        (()) can be used for grouping. For example:
                    </p>

                    <div class="code-box">
                        <code>
                            >>> 2 + 2 <br />
                            4 <br />
                            >>> 50 - 5*6 <br />
                            20 <br />
                            >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4 <br />
                            5.0 <br />
                            >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number <br />
                            1.6 <br />
                        </code>
                    </div>

                    <p>Python can manipulate text (represented by type str, so-called “strings”) 
                        as well as numbers. This includes characters “!”, words “rabbit”, names 
                        “Paris”, sentences “Got your back.”, etc. “Yay! :)”. They can be enclosed 
                        in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result</p>
                    
                    <div class="code-box">
                        <code>
                            >>> 'spam eggs' <br />
                            'spam eggs' <br />
                            >>> "Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!"  # double quotes <br />
                            'Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!' <br />
                            >>> '1975'  # digits and numerals enclosed in quotes are also strings <br />
                            '1975' <br />

                    <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other 
                        values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of 
                        comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain 
                        items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:</p>
                    <div class="code-box">
                        <code>
                            >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: ")) <br />
                            >>> Please enter an integer: 42 <br />
                            >>> if x < 0: <br />
                                x = 0 <br /> 
                                print('Negative changed to zero') <br />
                                elif x == 0: <br />
                                    print('Zero') <br />
                                elif x == 1: <br />
                                    print('Single') <br />
                                else: <br />
                                    print('More') <br />
                            More
                        </code>
                    </div>

                    <p>The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or 
                        Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of 
                        numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the 
                        iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates 
                        over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they 
                        appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):</p>
                    <div class="code-box">
                        <code>
                            >>> # Measure some strings: <br />
                                words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate'] <br />
                            >>> for w in words: <br />
                                    print(w, len(w)) <br />
                            cat 3 <br />
                            window 6 <br />
                            defenestrate 12 <br />
                        </code>
                    </div>

                    <p>If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function 
                        range() comes in handy. It generates arithmetic progressions:</p>
                    <div class="code-box">
                        <code>
                            >>> for i in range(5): <br />
                                print(i) <br />
                            0 <br />
                            1 <br />
                            2 <br />
                            3 <br />
                            4 
                        </code>

                    <p>The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list 
                        objects:</p>
                    <code>
                        <ul>
                            <li>list.append(x)</li>
                            <li>list.extend(iterable)</li>
                            <li>list.insert(i, x)</li>
                            <li>list.remove(x)</li>
                            <li>list.pop([i])</li>
                        </ul>
                    </code>
                    <p>An example that uses most of the list methods:</p>
                    <div class="code-box">
                        <code>
                            >>> fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'apple', 'banana'] <br />
                            >>> fruits.count('apple') <br />
                            2 <br />
                            >>> fruits.count('tangerine') <br />

                    <p>You might have noticed that methods like insert, remove or sort that only 
                        modify the list have no return value printed – they return the default None. 
                        This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in Python.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="main-section" id="Modules">
                    <header>Modules</header>
                    <p>If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you 
                        have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write 
                        a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare 
                        the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. 
                        This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want 
                        to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to 
                        use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying 
                        its definition into each program.</p>

                    <p>To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in 
                        a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is 
                        called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules 
                        or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to 
                        in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).</p>

                    <p>A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file 
                        name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the 
                        module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable 
                        __name__. For instance, use your favorite text editor to create a file called 
                        fibo.py in the current directory with the following contents:</p>
                
                    <div class="code-box">
                        <code>
                            # Fibonacci numbers module <br />
                            def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n <br />
                                a, b = 0, 1 <br />
                                while a < n: <br />
                                    print(a, end=' ') <br />
                                    a, b = b, a+b <br />
                                print() <br /> <br />
    
                            def fib2(n):   # return Fibonacci series up to n <br />
                                result = [] <br />
                                a, b = 0, 1 <br />
                                while a < n: <br />
                                    result.append(a) <br />
                                    a, b = b, a+b <br />
                                return result <br />
                        </code>
                    </div>

                    <p>Now enter the Python interpreter and import this module with the following 
                        command:</p>
                    <div class="code-box"><code>>>> import fibo</code></div>
                    
                    <p>This does not add the names of the functions defined in fibo directly to the 
                        current namespace (see Python Scopes and Namespaces for more details); it only 
                        adds the module name fibo there. Using the module name you can access the 
                        functions:</p>
                    <div class="code-box">
